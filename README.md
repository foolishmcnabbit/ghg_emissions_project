# ghg_emissions_project
A data analysis project looking at GHG emissions data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average companies, as well as top global emissions.

In this project I obtained the greenhouse gas emissions data of each of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Index and plotted their emissions in rank order. I also downloaded and visualized emissions data from the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world. 

An additional skill I utilized in this project was visualizing with Plotly, and I attempted to create a web app with Dash.
